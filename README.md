# Triple-X
A simple number guessing game to brush up on my C++ skills.<br/><br/>
The player must <i>hack</i> their way into a series of secure servers by guessing the correct codes.<br/>
The player will be given the sum and product of a set of three numbers (duplicates allowed). The range of possible integers will increase as the player hacks into more servers, ranging from 1 to the level's corresponding difficulty.<br/>
The player must correctly guess these three numbers before their guesses run out.

## Compile
Navigate to your directory within the Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019 (or a similar compiler). <br/>
From within the src folder, run `cl triple-x.cpp /EHsc` to compile the game code.

## Run
After compiling, run `.\triple-x.exe` from the same folder as the .exe file to play the game.
