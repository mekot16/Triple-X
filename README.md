# Triple-X
A simple number guessing game to brush up on my C++ skills.<br/><br/>
The player will be given the sum and product of a set of three numbers ranging 1-10 (duplicate numbers allowed).<br/>
The player will have to correctly guess these three numbers before their guesses run out.

## Compile
Navigate to your directory within the Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019 (or a similar compiler). <br/>
From within the src folder, run `cl triple-x.cpp /EHsc` to compile the game code.

## Run
After compiling, run `.\triple-x.exe` from the same folder as the .exe file to play the game.
